#Getting Started

Now that you have a basic understanding of how we will build the Trip Planner backend using flask, let's get started with the setup.

##Python 3

First of all, ensure that python 3 is currently installed by running this line in the terminal:

	python3 --version
	
If you have python 3 installed, you should see a response that confirms the latest python version (it should be 3.4 or higher):

	Python 3.4.0
	
If python 3 is not installed you should install it via homebrew:

	 brew install python3
	 
##Starter Project

We will be using a bunch of libraries to speed up development. While you can configure your project from scratch, I'd recommend starting with the starter project that has all of the dependencies defined and comes with a basic skeleton for your first web service.
