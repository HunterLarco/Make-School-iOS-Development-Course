The goal of this project is to introduce you to the most important concepts of iOS development. 

#Project Outline

The goal for this project is to build an iOS app that allows users to plan trips. Users can create trips and trips are defined by a collection of waypoints. Waypoints are represented by a geographic coordinate and a name. Users should be able to create, delete and modify trips.

The content the user creates in the app should be persisted using Core Data. The data should also be synchronized with a backend system that you should write using Python and the Flask framework.

#Screen Layout

Here are mockups of the individual screens the app should contain, including their connections to each other:
